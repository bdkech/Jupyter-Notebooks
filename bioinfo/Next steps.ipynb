    "#### Achilles data -> \n",
    "sh rna knockdown showed that several genes do impact the survivability of breast cancer cell lines.  One complication is this isn't freely available data, Lilly has a license for it.\n",
    "#### Lilly Libra -> \n",
    "Because of Tom Doman's involvement and recent efforts for secuirty and protect Lilly we'll need to do the Lilly publication vetting process, it should be quick.  There aren't any anticipated problems because there are no lilly compounds or targets used to do the analysis.\n",
    "#### Additional Literature review\n",
    "Papers I shared are TCGA methods of multi-omics datasets.  They still only perform their analysis on a gene-set level basis and without proper protein quantification (still uses immunohistochemsitry).\n",
